# Each discipline involves a roll of skill/std.

# speed: skill/std is secodns taken to complete, slip is chance of a slip that adds 10% to total time determined by skill and std.
# bouldering: skill/std is out of 10 points. If skill and std roll is greater than a boulder's zone/top difficulty, the zone.top is awarded. There are a fixed number of attempts per boulder per climber.
# bouldering: boulders are slab, dynmamic, traditional settings for boulders 1,2,3 respectively
# lead: skill/std is the number of holds. If slip chance is non-zero, the simulation will simulate the possiblity of the climber slipping from hold 0 to the maximum climbed hold determined by this round's roll.
# std refers to standard devitaion here, so its units will be the same as the one given for skill
